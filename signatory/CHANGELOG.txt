Dropped support for Python 3.6
Dropped support for Pytorch < 1.10.0

1.2.6
-----
Added support for PyTorch 1.8.0, 1.8.1, 1.9.0 and Python 3.9.

1.2.5
-----
Added signature inversion

1.2.4
-----
Added support for PyTorch 1.7.0, 1.7.1
Dropped support for Python 2.7, 3.5
Dropped support for PyTorch <1.6.0
Dropped support for MacOS

1.2.3
-----
Added support for PyTorch 1.6.0

1.2.2
-----
Added support for PyTorch 1.5.1
Fixed a bug that was introduced due to a backwards incompatibility introduced in PyTorch 1.5.0.

1.2.1
-----
Added support for Python 3.8
Added support for PyTorch 1.5.0
Added support for copying, shuffling, slicing and indexing Path.

1.2.0
-----
Added support for PyTorch 1.4.0
Added 'scalar_term' argument to the 'signature' function (and by extension many other functions that take signatures as arguments.)
Fixed certain cases for using Signatory on GPUs other than the default one.
Made SignatureToLogSignature and LogSignature classes deepcopyable.
Fixed the repr for LogSignature and SignatureToLogSignature.
Fixed some parallelism to achieve even greater speedups.
Released the Global Interpreter Lock during execution of Signatory's functions.
Bumped the minor version because frankly we've changed a lot since the 1.1.0 release!

1.1.6
-----
Added support for PyTorch 1.3.1
Added a proper reference to our arXiv paper. Very exciting!
Worked around a PyTorch bug (19213) affecting time benchmarking. (It caused the CPU parallelisation to sometimes be on when it should be off, and vice versa.)

1.1.5
-----
Added a logo! (Very exciting!)
Slightly improved the speed of forward signature computations on the CPU.
Moderately improved the speed of backward signature computations on the CPU.
Added the 'remember_path' option to Path.
Deprecated the max_parallelism function. It was a bad idea.
Added the 'parallel' and 'save' options to the benchmarks.

1.1.4
-----
Dramatically improved the speed of several calculations.
Added logsignature calculations to Path.
Added the signature_to_logsignature function.
Added the multi_signature_combine function.
Added the max_parallelism function.
Improved speed and stability of the backwards operation through Path.
Added (fixed) memory benchmarking

1.1.3
-----
Tweaks to be able to compile on different platforms.
Prebuilt wheels are now available via PyPI! (Making PyPI happy is the real reason this is a whole 'nother release.)

1.1.2
-----
Added signature_combine
Added the new optional argument 'initial' to signature and Signature.
Expanded the functionality of Path, in particular to allow updating it, and to be able give the signature of the whole
path cleanly.
Updated documentation with more examples, a clearer layout, and a few custom pieces of CSS to aid clarity.

1.1.1
-----
Speed improvements to signature and logsignature both forwards and backwards.
Added the all_words function
Added the Path class
signature and logsignature functions and classes now accept an 'inverse' option to calculate the inverse-signature or log-inverse-signature.

1.1.0
-----
Should now typically run even faster on typical batch sizes.
Worked around a major memory leak due to PyTorch bug 25340.
Worked around a minor issue (backwards operations silently failing if in-place operations are applied to the output of signature or logsignature), which was caused due to PyTorch bug 24413.
Added speed benchmarks.

1.0.0
-----
Added logsignatures. (No small feat!)
Added to the documentation.
Added utilities for computing Lyndon words and Lyndon brackets.

0.2.0
-----
Rewrote to compute the signature exactly, rather than its Riemann approximation.
Added better documentation, examples, and tests.

0.1.2
-----
Added support for Python 2.7.
New documentation: examples, and using py2annotate to generate type annotations.
Added lots of testing with the very poor man's makefile-equivalent of CI.

0.1.1
-----
Bugfixes for edge cases.
Some documentation fixes.
Added tests.

0.1.0
-----
Initial release!
