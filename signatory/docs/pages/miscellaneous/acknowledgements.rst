The Python bindings for the C++ code were written with the aid of `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`__.

For NumPy-based CPU-only signature calculations, you may also be interested in the `iisignature <https://github.com/bottler/iisignature>`__ package. The notes accompanying the iisignature project greatly helped with the implementation of Signatory.
